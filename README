Watson Advising System
======================

Description:
	Walkin system for the Watson Advising Office.

Known issues:
	* Not RESTful, and uses some AJAX/PHP practices that would probably be frowned upon, but I learned PHP/Jquery
		from this project so I'll chalk it up to that.
	* After Version 1.0 is released I will probably do a major rewrite utilizing Code Igniter, but for now I'm gonna
		leave the crappy code thats still getting the job done.

Bugs:
	* In development...
