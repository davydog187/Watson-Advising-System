Watson Advising System
======================

Description:
	Walkin system for the Watson Advising Office.

Known issues:
	Not RESTful, and uses some AJAX/PHP practices that would probably be frowned upon, but I learned PHP/Jquery from this project so I'll chalk it up to that.
	After Version 1.0 is released I will probably do a major rewrite utilizing Code Igniter, but for now I'm gonna leave the crappy code thats still getting the 
	job done.




Bugs:

PHP/JQUERY/MYSQL by David Lucia
